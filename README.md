# Credit Card Approval Prediction

## Project Overview
Commercial banks receive numerous credit card applications daily. Many of these applications get rejected due to factors such as high loan balances, low income levels, or excessive inquiries on an individual's credit report. Manually analyzing these applications is time-consuming, prone to errors, and inefficient. To optimize the process, banks leverage machine learning to automate credit card approval decisions.

In this project, we will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, simulating how real banks evaluate applications.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a subset of the **Credit Card Approval dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains records of credit card applications received by a bank, along with a final decision on approval or rejection.

### Features:
- Various attributes related to the applicant, such as income level, credit history, debt, and other financial indicators.
- The last column in the dataset represents the target variable (approval status: approved or rejected).

### Data File:
- `cc_approvals.data`: The dataset containing credit card applications.

## Project Goals
1. **Preprocess the Data**: Handle missing values, normalize numerical features, and encode categorical data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand the distribution of data and identify key patterns.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Select the most relevant features for prediction.
4. **Build Machine Learning Models**: Train classification model to predict credit card approval.
5. **Evaluate Model Performance**: Use accuracy to measure effectiveness.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage
1. Load the dataset (`cc_approvals.data`) into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Preprocess the data by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
3. Train and evaluate different machine learning models.
4. Deploy the best-performing model for automated credit card approval predictions.

## Expected Outcomes
- An efficient, automated system for predicting credit card approval.
- Insights into key factors that influence credit card approval decisions.
- A machine learning model that can assist banks in processing applications more effectively.
